## PRizm
Your AI reviewer for GitHub PRs


## What PRizm does
PRizm automatically reviews your pull requests and, using the diff and surrounding context, flags issues, risks, and improvement opportunities.
It posts actionable comments and suggestions directly on the PR so teams can merge faster and keep code quality high.
It fits the standard GitHub pull request review workflow where reviews are left on PRs as feedback (and can lead to approval or changes).
